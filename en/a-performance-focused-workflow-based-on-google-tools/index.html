This data covers the last 28 days of user experience. With this tool, you can get the user experience metrics evaluated at the 75th percentile. In other words, if 75% of user experiences are equal to, or better than the threshold set for the metric, then the performance is considered ‘good.’ A URL passes the CWV assessment when 75% of all visits to the page performed at or above CWV thresholds for FID, LCP, and CLS. You can compare the URL-level data with origin-level data to see if the individual URLs are better or worse than the origin-level metrics and understand what is unique about the particular page.</p><h4 id="lab-data-generated-by-lighthouse"><span id="Lab_data_generated_by_Lighthouse">Lab data, generated by Lighthouse <a href="#lab-data-generated-by-lighthouse" class="w-headline-link">#</a></span></h4><p>The overall Lighthouse score for the URL displays at the top of the page. Below the field data section is the lab data section that provides metrics collected from a real-time Lighthouse run and surfaces opportunities for the page.</p><p>Running PSI for different types of pages—analyzing the field data and opportunities—will provide you with a high-level understanding of metrics and improvements to focus on. With that information, you are now ready to debug and optimize your pages which we will discuss in the next section.</p><h2 id="step-b:-debug-and-optimize"><span id="Step_B_Debug_and_optimize">Step B: Debug and optimize <a href="#step-b:-debug-and-optimize" class="w-headline-link">#</a></span></h2><p><img alt="Image showing the tools used in this step: Lighthouse, Web Vitals Extension, Chrome DevTools." height="188" src="https://sadewadee.pages.dev/contents/uploads/2021/11/1635989050_627_A-performance-focused-workflow-based-on-Google-tools.png" width="800" decoding="async" loading="lazy"></p><ol><li>Use <a href="https://sadewadee.pages.dev/lighthouse-performance/">Lighthouse</a> to audit a page and uncover improvements.</li><li>Use the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-vitals/ahfhijdlegdabablpippeagghigmibma?hl=en" rel="noopener">Web Vitals extension</a> to analyze CWV metrics in real-time on a page.</li><li>Use <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/" rel="noopener">Chrome DevTools</a> to debug performance issues and test code changes.</li></ol><p>Once you have identified the pages and metrics that need attention, the next questions to ask are:</p><ul><li>How can these pages be optimized?</li><li>What are the low-hanging fruits to tackle immediately?</li><li>What improvements require more planning?</li></ul><h3 id="uncover-opportunities-with-lighthouse"><span id="Uncover_opportunities_with_Lighthouse">Uncover opportunities with Lighthouse <a href="#uncover-opportunities-with-lighthouse" class="w-headline-link">#</a></span></h3><p>The first step to answer these questions is using Lighthouse. It provides a snapshot of opportunities to improve the load performance for specific pages based on a lab run. You can access Lighthouse in several ways, including:</p><p>Lighthouse identifies critical areas of optimization at load time and by how much they could potentially improve the user experience. Quickly identifying low-effort fixes helps to start the optimization process before handling the bigger tasks.</p><p>While the metrics’ absolute values may be interesting to look at, keep in mind that they change based on the environment Lighthouse is running in and many other factors, such as the network conditions of the servers hosting the website and its third parties. In addition, Lighthouse simulates a user’s experience on a mid-tier mobile on a slow-4G connection, and might not represent your users’ experience at the 75th percentile (which the CWV metrics are based on). The metrics are a good indication of what is going on in a website, but we recommend focusing more on the optimization opportunities in the report.</p><div class="w-aside w-aside--note"><p>Lighthouse analyzes pages at load time in a lab environment. While lab assessments of LCP are often useful for debugging and optimizing LCP in the field, user actions affect CLS and FID in ways that are not always captured by lab measurements of page load alone.

To this end, you can use <a href="https://web.dev/lighthouse-ci/">Lighthouse-CI</a> with most continuous integration tools. Using this, you will be able to identify degrading PRs and work on optimizations before code releases go live and have an otherwise unexpected impact on users.</p><p>Keep in mind that the ideal setup to best identify areas of improvement involves continuous capturing of your own RUM data by leveraging tools and libraries such as <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals" rel="noopener">web-vitals.js</a>.</p><h2 id="conclusion"><span id="Conclusion">Conclusion <a href="#conclusion" class="w-headline-link">#</a></span></h2><figure class="w-figure"><img alt="A diagram of the cycle outlined in this article: evaluate website health and identify pain points, debug and optimize, monitor and continuous development." height="465" src="https://sadewadee.pages.dev/contents/uploads/2021/11/A-performance-focused-workflow-based-on-Google-tools.png" width="800" decoding="async" loading="lazy"><figcaption class="w-figcaption">Suggested workflow to optimize Core Web Vitals.</figcaption></figure><p>Ensuring great user experience requires a performance-first mindset and adopting the right strategy.
